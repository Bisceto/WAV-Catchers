Download model_hf.pth from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ENfQTFXGcbSBWj32beGirt5z8vfk-5hh
Copy/Cut model_hf.pth to same folder as audioclass_mqtt.py

Use audioclass_mqtt.py to start up Hubert Model and MQTT server. 
Use I2SAudioRecorder_withPB.ino for ESP32. Remember to change SSID, Password and Pin numbers to configure the ESP32 properly.
Once a Push Button is pressed, it will start recording and transfer audio files over MQTT to the server for x(currently 8) seconds. Once the recording is done, the .wav file is created locally on the PC and audio classification will be done.
